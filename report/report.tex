\chapter{Introduction}
In this project we look at the dynamic transitive closure problem of a directed unweighted graph $G$.

\begin{itemize}
\item{\texttt{init($n$)}: $G$ becomes the empty directed graph with vertices $\left\lbrace 0,\dots, n-1\right\rbrace$ and no edges.}
\item{\texttt{insert($i,j$)}: Inserts an edge from $i$ to $j$ into $G$ (if it is not already contained in $G$).}
\item{\texttt{delete($i,j$)}: Deletes an edge from $i$ to $j$ from $G$ (if it is contained in $G$).}
\item{\texttt{transitiveClosure?}: Returns the total number of edges in the transitive closure graphs.}
\end{itemize}

We are going to implement two dynamic algorithms for this problem. The first, presented in section \ref{chap:fw}, is a trivial solution based on the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for computing all pairs shortest paths. The next solution, presented in \ref{chap:sankowski}, is based on Sankowskis randomized reduction to dynamic matrix adjoint combined with the use of the Sherman-Morrison formula.

The second solution requires us to do arithmetic modulo a prime $p$. We are thus going to describe algorithms for this in time $O(log^2 p)$ in section \ref{chap:prime}.

Finally we are going to experimentally test both algorithms and compare their running time on different inputs interesting to this problem.
