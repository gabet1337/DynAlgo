\chapter{Introduction}
In this project we look at the dynamic transitive closure problem of a directed unweighted graph $G$.

\begin{itemize}
\item{\texttt{init($n$)}: $G$ becomes the empty directed graph with vertices $\left\lbrace 0,\dots, n-1\right\rbrace$ and no edges.}
\item{\texttt{insert($i,j$)}: Inserts an edge from $i$ to $j$ into $G$ (if it is not already contained in $G$).}
\item{\texttt{delete($i,j$)}: Deletes an edge from $i$ to $j$ from $G$ (if it is contained in $G$).}
\item{\texttt{transitiveClosure?}: Returns the total number of edges in the transitive closure graphs.}
\end{itemize}

We are going to implement two dynamic algorithms for this problem. The first, presented in section \ref{chap:fw}, is a trivial solution based on the Floyd-Warshall algorithm for computing all pairs shortest paths. The next solution, presented in \ref{chap:sankowski}, is based on Sankowskis randomized reduction to dynamic matrix adjoint combined with the use of the Sherman-Morrison formula.

The second solution requires us to do arithmetic modulo a prime $p$. We are thus going to describe algorithms for this in time $O(log^2 p)$ in section \ref{chap:prime}.

Finally we are going to experimentally test both algorithms and compare their running time on different inputs interesting to this problem.


\chapter{Floyd-Warshall}
\label{chap:fw}

Floyd-Warshalls algorithm is an algorithm for finding all-pairs shortest path in a directed graph. The algorithm in its traditional form uses a bottom-up dynamic programming approach to compute the shortest-path weights. It does so using the following recurrence:

$$
d_{ij}^{(k)} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
w_{ij} &\mbox{ if $k=0$} \\
\min\left(d_{ij}^{(k-1)}, d_{ik}^{(k-1)} + d_{kj}^{(k-1)}\right) &\mbox{ if $k \geq 1$}
\end{array} \right.
$$

In the k'th iteration the Floyd-Warshall algorithm considers the shortest path from $i$ to $j$ with intermediate vertices in the set $\left\lbrace 1,2,\dots,k-1\right\rbrace$. It computes the k'th iteration by decomposing the path from $i$ to $j$ into $i \rightsquigarrow k \rightsquigarrow j$. Since $k$ is not an intermediate vertex of the path $i\rightsquigarrow k$ or $k\rightsquigarrow j$ we have that we have already computed the shortest path of these paths and can easily expand our solution using the recurrence.

We are, however, interested in computing the transitive closure of a directed graph and not all-pairs shortest path, but the Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be easily modified to solve this problem.

We do this by assigning a weight of 1 to each edge in our graph. If there's a path from $i$ to $j$ we will have that $d_{ij} < n$ otherwise $d_{ij} = \infty$. Another more efficient and simpler way is to replace the use of arithmetic operations with logical operations $\wedge$ and $\vee$. The k'th iteration computes whether there is a path from $i$ to $j$ by checking if it already exists or if it exists by considering the path $i\rightsquigarrow k\rightsquigarrow j$. By the same argument as before, we have already computed whether a path exists from $i$ to $k$ and $k$ to $j$. The recurrence becomes:

$$
t_{ij}^{(k)} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
0 &\mbox{ if $i \neq j $ and $ (i,j)\not\in E$} \\
1 &\mbox{ if $i = j $ and $ (i,j)\in E$}
\end{array} 
\right.
&\mbox{ if $k=0$} \\
t_{ij}^{(k-1)} \vee \left(d_{ik}^{(k-1)} \wedge d_{kj}^{(k-1)}\right) &\mbox{ if $k \geq 1$}
\end{array} \right.
$$

The algorithm for computing the transitive closure using Floyd-Warshall is repeated in algorithm~\ref{alg:fw}. The complexity of this algorithm is trivially $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ by the triple \texttt{for} loops.

The complexity of each operation is also quite simple. In the lazy solution we only compute the transitive closure when needed and we can thus do \texttt{insert} and \texttt{delete} in $\mathcal{O}(1)$. \texttt{init} can be done in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ using lazy initialization but our solution simply initializes the adjacency matrix and transitive closure graph upfront using $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ operations. Finally the transitive closure can be computed in $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$.

Another solution is to eagerly update the transitive closure matrix on each \texttt{insert} and \texttt{delete} giving these operations a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$. \texttt{init} has the same complexity as the lazy solution, but we are now able to report number of edges in the transitive closure graph in $\mathcal{O}(1)$.

The complexities are repeated in figure~\ref{fig:fw-comp}.

\chapter{Arithmetic modulo $p$}
\label{chap:prime}
In order to achieve the bounds presented in section~\ref{chap:sankowski} we need to be able to do fast arithmetic operations modulo $p$. We used that the operations can be performed in $\mathcal{O}(\log^2(p))$. This is trivially true for all operations except division, since they are simply the normal operation followed by a modulo operation.

We cannot just use normal division when in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. We need to compute the modular inverse of the denominator and multiply this with the numerator modulo $p$. We need to show that the modular inverse can be computed in $\mathcal{O}(\log^2(p))$. We will compute the modular inverse using the extended euclidean algorithm. In addition to computing the greatest common divisor $d$ of $a$ and $b$, the extended euclidean algorithm also computes $x$ and $y$ such that $d = ax+by$ (BÃ©zout's identity). If we compute this identity with $b = p$ we have that $1 = ax+py$, since the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $p$ will always be $1$ in the field $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. all elements have an inverse. Now the modular inverse of $a$ is simply $x$ modulo $p$. Lets sum up these results in algorithm~\ref{alg:modinv} for computing the modular inverse modulo $p$.
